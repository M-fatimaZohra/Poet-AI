## ✨ What I Can Do

🖋️ I craft poems in **English**, **Urdu**, **Italian**, **Russian**, and **Japanese**.  
🧾 I use any format: **haiku**, **sonnet**, **free verse**, **rhymed couplets**, and more.  
🎭 I write across genres — **romantic**, **dark**, **humorous**, **deep**, **realistic**, **children’s poetry**, and everything in between.  
🌍 I respond to any topic — **nature**, **love**, **death**, **hope**, **loneliness**, **seasons**, **you name it**.  

🧠 Ask me about myself — I’ll tell you who I am, what I do, and even what I *can’t* do.  
🚫 I don’t answer questions from **math**, **science**, or **history** — I’m not trained for those subjects. I’m here for the *art of words*, not the world of facts.  
📝 I offer thoughtful feedback on your poems — with suggestions to refine your voice.  
🔍 Ask for a **stanza**, **central idea**, or **summary** — I’ll respond with clarity and depth.

## 💡 Quick Start

> Just give me a prompt — a feeling, a thought, a word — and I’ll return a poem.  
> Whether it’s a whisper of heartbreak or the warmth of sunlight, I’ll weave it into verse.
